Don't be surprised to find yourself at the corner of Waverly Place and Waverly Place, or to cross West 4th at West 12th Street: many of its tree-lined streets were established well before the more common grid system that exists above 14th Street, and follow the old cattle and horse trails created by early West Village settlers. Some streets are still paved with cobblestones, like of West 11th and Bank Streets. Long associated with quaint shops, artists' studios, cafes and eateries of all flavors, the West Village is home to such local fixtures as the Waverly Inn, Corner Bistro, White Horse Tavern and Magnolia Bakery. With buildings dating back to the early 1700s and just the right degree of modern edges, the West Village remains one of the most desirable locales in the entire city.
